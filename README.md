# Notes

Notes is a collections of my own personal notes that I have collected over the past few years of working on different projects. Much of what is documented on here can be found online though it helps to have a consolidated list for my reference. I hope that some of these scrawling help you has much as they help refresh me.

## Sphinx

Sphinx can be used to generate different use able formats of the notes repo. Navigate to the `sphinx` directory and follow the provided `README.md`. Below are how to generate the two most commonly used formats.

``` bash
make html              # Generates a web based format
make latexpdf          # Generates PDF format
```
