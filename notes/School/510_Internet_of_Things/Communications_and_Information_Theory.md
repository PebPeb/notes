## Bitrate Limits

Shannon-Hartley theorem

$$ C = B*log_2(1+\frac{S}{N}) $$

$C$ = Channel capacity in bits per second\
$B$ = Channel bandwidth in hertz\
$S$ = Average received signal measured in watts\
$N$ = Average noise on the channel measured in watts\
$\frac{S}{N}$ = Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). It often uses 10log10(S/N) in dB
