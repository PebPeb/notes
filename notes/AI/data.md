- *Label* - Is the target of a model so for example if the model is trying to predict what the image is of then the label would be what that image is (A picture of a cat would be cat). 
- *Feature* - Is the numerical data that makes up the 

# Data in AI

- **Dimensionality** - Is the length of the numerical features of the input vectors
  - **Fixed-Length** - Is input vectors that are of the same length
  - **Varying-Length**

Data is key to the success of modern day models

## Objective Functions

Tells how good or bad a model is preforming.

- Loss Functions
- Squared Error


# Learning Problems

## Supervised Learning

Is when the dataset contains both features and labels, and the goal is to produce a model that predicts the labels when given input features.


### Regression
