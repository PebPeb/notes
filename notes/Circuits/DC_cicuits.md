# Digital Circuits

## Kirchhoffâ€™s Rules

**Junction Rule**: Sum of all current entering a node must be the sum of all current leaving the node.

**Loop Rule**: The sum of all the electric potential across a given path (loop) must be zero.



## MOSFETs

**MOSFET**: Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

MOSFETs tend to be the more widely used as compared to BJTs. This is especially relevant in Integrated Circuits (ICs).
