## Kirchhoffâ€™s Rules

**Junction Rule**: Sum of all current entering a node must be the sum of all current leaving the node.

**Loop Rule**: The sum of all the electric potential across a given path (loop) must be zero.


## Diodes

A diode is the simplest nonlinear circuit element. Unlike a resistor that has a linear relationship between current and voltage across it, the diode has a nonlinear *i-v* characteristic.

### Ideal Diode

An ideal diode only allows for current to flow in one direction. 

**Reverse Biased**: This is when a negative voltage is applied across the diode. During this state an ideal diode has no current flowing across. This is said to be **cut off**.
**Forward Biased**: This is when a positive voltage is applied across the diode. During this state an ideal diode has zero voltage drop across the diode. This is said to be **turned on**.


## MOSFETs

**MOSFET**: Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

MOSFETs tend to be the more widely used as compared to BJTs. This is especially relevant in Integrated Circuits (ICs).
