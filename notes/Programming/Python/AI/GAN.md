# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)


## Generator

In the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a generator is a neural network that learns to create new data instances that resemble the training data. It takes random noise as input and transforms it into realistic outputs, such as images, text, or audio. The generator is trained in tandem with a discriminator, which tries to distinguish between real and generated data.
