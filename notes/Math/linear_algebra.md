## Norms

Norms of a vector informally tell how big it . The $\ell_2$ norm measures the Euclidean of a vector (Euclidean, is the length of the line segment between two points, pythagorean theorem on two dimensional graph). 

$$||x||_2=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x^2_i}}$$

Manhattan distance $\ell_1$

$$||x||_1=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x^2_i}$$

Or more generically can be references as $\ell_p$ norms

$$||x||_p=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x^2_i}\right) ^{1/p}$$

Frobenius norm

$$||X||_F=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x^2_{ij}}}}$$
